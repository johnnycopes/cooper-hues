### Live site: https://cooper-hues.surge.sh/

A project built with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks!) This app lets you browse the collection of the Smithsonian's premier design museum, the Cooper Hewitt, by colors present in the collection's many items. Clicking on a color in the palette will show all items containing the chosen color (or colors, plural -- you can select up to three at once). Also includes pagination for easier filtration.

#### Goals of this project:

- Build a web app in vanilla JavaScript without a framework or TypeScript
- Utilize an unfamiliar third-party API to provide an interesting data set
- Learn about ES modules

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
